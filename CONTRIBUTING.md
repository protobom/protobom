## Development Guide

For detailed information on setting up your development environment and contributing to the protobom repository, please refer to the [Development Guide](/docs/development.md).

## Code Style

We strive to maintain a consistent code style throughout the project. When contributing to the Go library, please ensure your code follows the following guidelines:

- Use meaningful variable and function names following the camel case convention (`myVariable`, `myFunction`).
- Write clear and concise comments to describe your code's purpose and functionality.
- Adhere to Go formatting guidelines by running using gofumpt and can be ran using `golangci-lint run` or by using recommit hooks. 
- Follow the best practices and idiomatic style described in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

## Testing

We highly encourage writing tests for new features and bug fixes. This ensures the stability and reliability of the codebase. There is unit/integration testing and conformance testing. 

### Conformance Testing
The purpose of conformance testing is to ensure that the system or software meets the requirements set forth by the relevant standards or specifications. Reference [README.md](test/conformance/README.md) for more details about conformance testing.

### Unit & Integration Testing
 we strive to keep our test coverage high so please add tests to any functions you introduce by your contributions.
