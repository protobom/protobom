# Reporting Security Issues

To report as security issue in the protobom family of projects, please use
the GitHub
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/protobom/protobom/security/advisories/new)
tool. The maintainers will give your report the maximum priority possible
and will try to triage it right away. We will also credit you if protobom choses
to issue a formal advisory.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

the project that has not been patched yet.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

* You found a bug or malfunction in the protobom code (not security related).
* You want to add a feature to protobom.
* You found an insecure use of the protobom libraries or tools in another project.
